Piezo Electric Tile

Innovative Prototype:
We have pioneered a groundbreaking technology that converts discarded plastic into energy-generating tiles. These tiles, made from 100% recycled plastic waste, can be interconnected to form a larger energy-harvesting surface.

Key Innovations:

Plastic Waste Transformation: Tiles are crafted from recycled plastic, reducing landfill waste and promoting sustainability.
Interconnected Design: Tiles can be easily linked to amplify energy output.
Piezoelectric Energy Generation: Tiles produce up to 8-10 volts of electricity with a single press.
Modular and Scalable: Tiles can be combined to increase energy output, making them suitable for various applications.

Potential Impact:

Empowering Villages: Providing sustainable energy for homes, schools, and healthcare centers in underserved communities.
Smart City Integration: Incorporating tiles into urban infrastructure to generate clean energy.
Renewable Energy Source: Contributing to a sustainable energy mix and reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

Benefits:

Clean Energy Generation: Produces sustainable energy from waste plastic, minimizing carbon footprint.
Waste Reduction: Diverts plastic waste from landfills and oceans, promoting a circular economy.
Trailblazing Solution: Showcases a unique approach to addressing energy and waste management challenges.
